This information is provided in our Privacy Policy and it is important that you read that information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please take care when disclosing any information about yourself on or through our websites or Games.

We strongly recommend that you exercise caution, act sensibly and not disclose any information which you do not wish to have disseminated into the wider public internet.

If you paid for the Game, content or services in connection with a Game or website, you will not be entitled to a refund where you have substantially had the enjoyment of what you had paid for.

For example, if we release an update with a new set of T&amp;Cs, and you don\u2019t use the update, then the old set of T&amp;Cs applies, but if you do use the updates or if you use parts of the Game(s) that rely on our ongoing online services then the new T&amp;Cs will apply. Please check back at our website from time to time in case of updates to the T&amp;Cs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may transfer our rights and obligations under these T&amp;Cs to another organisation. We will let you know if that happens and we will ensure that your rights under these T&amp;Cs are unaffected. You may not transfer your rights or obligations under these T&amp;Cs unless we expressly agree to the transfer in writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if we delay in enforcing these T&amp;Cs and\/or our rights, we can still enforce these T&amp;Cs and\/or our rights later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these T&amp;Cs, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking of any term of these T&amp;Cs, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These T&amp;Cs are governed by English law and you can bring proceedings in respect of the relevant Game or these T&amp;Cs in the English courts.

If you are not happy with how we have handled any complaint, you may want to consider an alternative dispute resolution provider. In addi-tion, please note that disputes may be submitted for online resolution to the European Commission Online Dispute Resolution platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>COMPANY AND CONTACT INFORMATION<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In these T&amp;Cs, \u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018our\u2019 refers to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Victoria VR, a.s., (&#8220;Victoria VR&#8221;).
